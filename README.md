# Tkinter introduction notes

I made this repo as a way of keeping track of my own progress as well the notes I made following Clear Code's course.
I did not follow the code the exact same way as the tutorial, especially once classes were introduced as I prefer that approach to the functional one.

Full credit of the course goes to
